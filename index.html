																					<div class="bullet-item-title">Same cost
Scoty: easy to use (any age group can drive), unisex ,storag, good for city ride ,height is less
Small wheels , can’t go for long ride , less milage , 
Bike: more fuel capacity , better for long ride , more speed , more comfort , metal body (tougher) , good for bad roads , less maintenance
More variety , tyre radius is more , less risk of getting slip , fun of playing with gears , no fun in driving at slow speed for a long time , For tall people  keeping legs in bikes is easier than scooter(may get back pain or leg pain if sits on scooter for a long time , bad headlight in scooter , mouse might get inside and eat up the wires 9 hence more maintenance) ; no space to enter in bike. </div>

																							<div>Basic components of 4 store Bike engine 
A piston , a connecting rod , crankshaft
Piston moves up and down ; this lateral motion gets converted into rotatory motion in crankshaft
The longer the stroke of the piston , the larger the displacement of the gas and air occurs in the cylinder 
To propel that piston , we need to ignite a tiny bit of gas and whole lot of air , this creates expansion inside the cylinder
The fuek Delivery System consist of Intake Manifold , intake exhaust valves , a fuel injector and a spark plug
A 4 stroke engine is called so because it takes 4 strokes for the piston to complete a cycle . 1st : intake stroke (piston moves down) , 2nd : compression stroke (piston moves up) {the spark plug fires) , 3rd: combustion stroke , 4th : exhaust stroke

																												<div class="text-muted">Low capacity  , or high power
Outside India , like the European countries , the starter bikes are 300-400cc since the infrastructure and rules are very good compared to India
2 categories of buyers : yet to learn (between 150-250 cc) You will not realise how much torque you have and most accidents happen with guys who have no clue about the speed and momentum they’re going on and then within 2-3 years you can upgrade and don’t go on flow to buy expensive bike ,first you need to absorb for a few years of experience and then you can rock and blast the way you want on the road keeping yourself and the surroundings safe. The unconscious behaviour , (the six sense you can say you take it through experience , it doesn’t come overnight. 200 cc bike (KTM 200 is so pwerful25 BHP , you  are getting power , you are getting technology  .there is a liability on you that you have to reach home safe; already learnt on Dad’s or friends’ bikes(buy between 150-500CC bike) Since you have the experience and know about the Indian roads and the public around you and have presence of mind , i.e. a Litre class motorcycle ; You have a lot of power Ain hand and need to be responsible enough

                                It is so frustrating , when you’re trying to start your vechile and you press the start button over and over again , but all in vain an it never fires up . PS : If these don’t work , please seek professional help and have it repaired properly
1st : Compression test : Remove the Spark plug and insert your compression tester (you might find in toolkit or or any of the repairing shop), put the accelerator to full and then press the start button, until the needle on the gauge starts climbing {If its 100-120 PSI (Pounds per square inch) of compression in order to run
2. Ignition Spark : Reinstall the Spark  plug and ground it to the engine {find a place where the spark plug is in nice position not to fall[avoid holding on to the wire so that you do not get shock , make sure the engine is on and  you shook see a nice blue spark , if you don’t see the spark , the re is an ignition problem and needs to addressed 
3. Furl air mixture : Remove the air filter and air box if needed  to gain access to the intake tractTake starting fluid and spray a small amount directly into the carburettors  , try and start the engine [It should run for a few seconds => a fuel delivery problem]
4. Weak battery or dead battery: keep bike in 1st gear , press full clutch, let the bike go in a little speed [like 15kmph] and the suddenly leave the clutch and rotate the accelerator 2-3 times and the bike starts
5. Forgot to fuel your bike at right time : Shake the bike so that wherever the petrol is it may enter fuel up your engine [ use mobile flash to see if petrol is present in tank or not] { see if petrol lock is on or Reserve mode
6. See if exhaust if blocked ,I/e air cannot leave [kids may insert something inside it or some dirt inside the pipe] :See if air is coming out of the pipe properly or not [ if not , goto a mechanic]
7. Spark plug Amy be lose:this happens mainly due to washing the bike . After 4000rpm the bike may suddenly stop [ make sure it it tightly connected , press it properly [ keeping the ignition off]
